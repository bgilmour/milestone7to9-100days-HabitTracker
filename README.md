# Milestone7to9 (HabitTracker)

This is an implementation of the milestone challenge which was to create an activity tracking app. I'm not a list writing kind of person so I really didn't care much for this as an app although it did have some technical challenges. The lack of attention to detail in the UI really shows in this implementation. Really, I did it because it was part of the course and, although there's a lot more that I could have done with it, I won't be revisiting it any time soon.

The milestone challenge follows on from projects 7 to 9 in the [100 Days Of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui/) tutorial created by Paul Hudson ([@twostraws](https://github.com/twostraws)).
